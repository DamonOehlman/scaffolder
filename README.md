# Scaffolder

Scaffolder is a node package that is designed to make the process of making
node CLI applications simpler.  The project is a work in
progress, and pull requests are definitely welcome.

## Overview

I've written quite a few cli tools using node now, and initially I used
[commander](https://github.com/visionmedia/commander.js) a bit and then
experimented with
[my own cli focused library](https://github.com/DamonOehlman/climate).
Once I came across [nopt](https://github.com/isaacs/nopt) though everything
changed, and I've been pretty much using it exclusively since.

While nopt provides amazing option parsing functionality, there are things
I do find myself doing again and again when writing cli apps.


Things such as:

- copying particular files from one place to another
- running blocks of code in response to the user requesting a particular
  action from the command line

Scaffolder is designed to ease the process of making CLI apps using node
by adopting some conventions for writing your CLI app.

## Writing a CLI application using Scaffolder

The first thing you should probably do if you are writing a CLI application
in node, is to create a simple shell script that will run your application.
For my applications that make use of scaffolder such a script looks
something like this:

```
#!/usr/bin/env node
require('scaffolder')();
```

This code is significantly less than what you would see in most shell
scripts that kick off a node process and this is because of the
conventions that Scaffolder uses.

## Scaffolder Conventions

Before reading this section, I would encourage you to read the README
for the [nopt](https://github.com/isaacs/nopt) package as some understanding
of how nopt works will be helpful.

### Command Handlers

A CLI application built using scaffolder will likely be powered by a number
of command handlers.  A command handler is simply a node module (usually
located in the `./commands` folder for the project) that provides a
number of exports that make the command work.  In the simplest case a
command handler will look like this:

```js
exports.description = 'A test action';
exports.run = function(opts, callback) {
    callback(null, 'ok');
};
```

Typically, though a command handler will use a variety of command-line
flags to modify it's behaviour and these can be configured by providing
an `args` export, e.g.

```js
exports.args = {
    url:    'url',
    path:   path
};
```

These arguments are defined as per standard
[nopt](https://github.com/isaacs/nopt) options and an optional `shorthand`
export can also be provided to provide shorthand equivalents for the
defined options.

Once defined in the `args` export, any arguments that are parsed
successfully from `process.argv` will be provided as part of the `opts`
object that is passed into the `run` function declared in the command
handler.

## Overriding Scaffolder Defaults

When scaffolder is run (using `require('scaffolder')()`) a number of
default options are passed through, but these can be overriden by providing
an options object.  The defaults of this options object are shown below:

```js
require('scaffolder')({
  // an array of default command strings that will attempt to
  // be invoked if no options are provided
  defaultCommands: [],

  // provide any default args that individual commands
  // will incorporate / overwrite
  defaultArgs: {},

  // default nopt shorthand options
  defaultShorthand: {},

  // the path the scaffolder commands will be loaded from
  commandPath: '', // defaults to the commands/ folder of the project
});
```

## Scaffolder Helpers

When running an action, scaffolder provides a number of helper methods
for performing common tasks.

### Copying Files

```js
scaffolder.copy(src, dst, callback);
```

The `copy` method provides an interface to the really useful
[ncp](https://github.com/AvianFlu/ncp) which can be used to copy all
the files in `src` to `dst`.  The scaffolder `copy` method also ensures
that the `dst` directory exists before starting the copy operation.

__NOTE:__ The `src` path is relative to the npm package that has
incorporated scaffolder (unless absolute), but `dst` path is relative
to the cwd.

## Reference

### Scaffolder(opts)

#### getPath(callback)

Get the path the scaffolder considers the source path

#### loadActions(opts, callback)

#### loadPackage(opts, callback)

#### main(opts, handler)

#### read(prompts, callback)

Request either a single prompt from the user, or a series of prompts and
then return the results from the prompt.

#### run(name, opts?, callback)

Run the requested command with the supplied opts (if provided).  Upon
completion of the command the callback will be triggered.

#### squirrel(requirements, opts, callback)
