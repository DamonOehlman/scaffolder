Scaffolder
==========

Scaffolder is a "boots and all" package for writing `Node.js`_ command line applications.  It's designed to provide you pretty much all the functionality you will need to build a command-line application.  Additionally, to keep the core as light as possible Scaffolder uses `Squirrel`_ to bring in additional Node packages via `NPM`_ for functionality like templating, etc.

Scaffolder is also built with "convention over configuration" in mind to help get you writing command-line applications as quickly as possible.
